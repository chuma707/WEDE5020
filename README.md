# WEDE5020
UPDATED VERSION
# YEEZY Website Homepage

This is the updated homepage for the YEEZY fashion brand. I redesigned the page to give it a more modern and polished look that better reflects the brand’s image. It now includes improved layout, cleaner styling, and smoother navigation.

## What’s New (Compared to the First Version)

### Visual Design
- The first version had very little styling — it was quite plain.
- In this version, I added a separate CSS file (`styles.css`) that controls all the styling.
- The font, layout, spacing, and buttons are all styled to feel more professional.

### Navigation Bar
- The old navigation menu was basic and unstyled.
- Now it includes a dropdown setup (currently empty), and looks much cleaner with hover effects.

### Hero Section
- Previously, there was no real content or structure in the welcome section.
- I’ve added a title, full paragraph introducing the brand, and a clear button that links to the product page.

### Code Organization
- All styles have been moved out of the HTML file and into a dedicated CSS file.
- This keeps the HTML clean and makes future updates easier.

### Footer
- Added a footer section with brand credit and a copyright.
